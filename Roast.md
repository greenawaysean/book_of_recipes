# Roast
The Sunday Roast is a traditional British main meal that is typically served on Sunday (hence the name), consisting of roasted meat, roast potatoes, or mashed potatoes, and accompaniments such as Yorkshire Pudding, stuffing, gravy and mint sauce. Vegetables such as cauliflower often in the form of cauliflower cheese, roast parsnips, Brussels sprouts (typically termed brussel sprouts), peas, carrots, runner beans, and broccoli, can be part of the dish. The Sunday Roast is also popular in many parts of Ireland, especially in most of Ulster (chiefly in Northern Ireland and County Donegal) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_roast).
